<img src= "eyes.png" width='300' />

## Project discription
Given a web page with a single eye that follows the movement of the mouse on the screen the goal of the project was to create a second eye which would also follow the movement of the mouse anywhere on the screen. 
## How to run
The progam will run on the selected browser and you can begin moving the mouse anywhere on the screen and both eyes will follow the movement in sync. 

## Roadmap of future imporovments
Adding hands that reach in the direction of the mouse is the next improvement down the line.
